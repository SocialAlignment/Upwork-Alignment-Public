I need to overhaul the Pricing page to be "Visual-First" because Upwork fields change by category. Please make these 4 major updates:

1. UPDATE `client/src/components/file-upload.tsx`:
   - Update the component to accept an `accept` prop (string) so I can use it for Images (image/*) or PDFs.
   - Update the `label` prop to be dynamic (default to "Upload File").

2. UPDATE `client/src/pages/pricing.tsx`:
   - Remove the hardcoded manual entry fields for tiers.
   - Add the `<FileUpload>` component configured for images (`accept="image/*"`).
   - Add a "Analyze Pricing Page" button.
   - Add a display section for "AI Recommendations":
     - This should render a list of **"Field Mapping"**: e.g., "Field Name -> Suggested Value".
     - Display the "Strategic Rationale" for *why* we are pricing it this way.

3. UPDATE `server/routes.ts`:
   - Modify `POST /api/pricing-suggestions` to handle `multipart/form-data` (file upload) using Multer.
   - Pass the uploaded image buffer to the AI service.

4. UPDATE `server/ai-service.ts`:
   - Update `generatePricingSuggestions` to accept an `imageBuffer`.
   - Change the Anthropic API call to use the **Vision capabilities** (sending the image in the message).
   - Update the System Prompt:
     "You are an expert Upwork Pricing Strategist. Analyze the attached screenshot of an Upwork pricing page.
     1. Identify every input field, checkbox, and dropdown visible.
     2. Based on the user's project idea ('[projectIdea]') and the 'Target Hourly Rate' ($100/hr), tell the user EXACTLY what to fill in for each field.
     3. If you see 'Add-ons' or 'Extra Services' in the screenshot, suggest which ones to check/fill.
     4. Calculate if the prices you suggest meet the user's profitability goal."

   - Return a JSON structure:
     ```json
     {
       "fields": [
         { "label": "Name of field in screenshot", "value": "What to type/select", "rationale": "Why?" }
       ],
       "estimatedProfitability": "High/Medium/Low",
       "strategyNote": "Advice on how to frame this price"
     }
     ```
