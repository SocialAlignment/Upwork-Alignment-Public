The Pricing Logic is too broad. It is creating "Bundles" of unrelated services instead of "Tiers" of the SAME service. I need to fix this to keep prices competitive.

Please UPDATE `server/ai-service.ts` inside `generatePricingSuggestions`.
REPLACE the `prompt` string with this strictly scoped version:

const prompt = \`You are an expert Upwork pricing strategist. Your goal is to structure pricing for a SINGLE specific service, based on SCOPE and DELIVERABLES, not by bundling unrelated services.

PROJECT: "\${projectTitle}" (${projectCategory})
IDEA: "\${projectIdea}"

CRITICAL PRICING RULES (STAY IN YOUR LANE):
1. NO SERVICE BLOAT: If the project is "Music Production", do NOT include "Marketing" or "Social Media" in the tiers.
2. COMPETITIVE ANCHORING: The "Standard" tier must be the market rate for a professional, complete result. Do not inflate it.
3. TIER STRUCTURE (SCOPE BASED):
   - STARTER: "The Minimum Viable Result". (e.g., Basic Audio Clean, Rough Draft, Template-based). Low effort, low price.
   - STANDARD: "The Professional Standard". (e.g., Broadcast Ready, Full Production, Custom Design). This is what 80% of clients want.
   - ADVANCED: "The Power User Pack". (e.g., Includes Source Files, Stems, Commercial Rights, Extra Revisions). SAME service, but with more ASSETS/RIGHTS.
